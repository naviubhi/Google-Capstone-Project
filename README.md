**Cyclistic Bike-share Case Study**

In this case study, I work as a data analyst in the Marketing analytics team at Cyclistic. I analyze historical bike trip data from Cyclistic in order to identify trends and insights on how ride behavior differs between their two main customer groups (Casual customers vs. Members). From my insights, I create strategies and recommendations for the Marketing team to help reach there goal in converting casual riders into members to boost revenue and growth.

The historical data has been made available by [Motivate International Inc.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) under [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is a public data set and there is no personal user information data being shared.
