# Google Capstone Project
**Cyclistic Bike-share Case Study**

The purpose of this project was to help build marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members through understanding their riding habits.

For this project, I used Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by [Motivate International Inc.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) under [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is a public data set and there is no personal user information data being shared.
